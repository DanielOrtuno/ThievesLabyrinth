# ThievesLabyrinth
Dungeon Crawler built in a custom engine. 

The game was developed in four months. We were a small team of five programmers and decided to build both the engine and the game from scratch. I developed the engine foundations, rendering system, animations, and shaders, while also helping other friends in the particle systems and some gameplay logic.
